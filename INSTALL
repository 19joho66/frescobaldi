INSTALL for Frescobaldi 2.0.
============================

You can run Frescobaldi without installing. Just unpack and then run:

  python frescobaldi


The Frescobaldi package is based on distutils. No build process is needed as
Frescobaldi is fully written in the interpreted Python language. To install in
the default location:

  sudo python setup.py install


To run Frescobaldi, then simply type

  frescobaldi


If you want to install into /usr instead of /usr/local:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr


If you have a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, and you get the error
message "ImportError: No module named frescobaldi_app.main", try:

  python setup.py install --install-layout=deb


See the distutils documentation for more install options.


Dependencies:
=============

Frescobaldi 2.0 is written in Python version 2.6 or 2.7 (3.x support is planned)
and depends on Qt4.7 and PyQt4.8, and uses the python-poppler-qt4 binding to
Poppler for the built-in PDF preview.

For MIDI the PortMidi library is used, either via importing pyportmidi.midi, or,
if that is not available, loading the pygame.pypm module or, as a last resort,
embedding the PortMidi C-library via ctypes. MIDI is optional.

Required:
    Python:
        http://www.python.org/
    Qt4:
        http://qt.nokia.com/
    PyQt4:
        http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/
    Poppler:
        http://poppler.freedesktop.org/
    python-poppler-qt4:
        http://python-poppler-qt4.googlecode.com/

Optional:
    PortMidi:
        http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/

Of course you'll need to install one or more versions of LilyPond!
