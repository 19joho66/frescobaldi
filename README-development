README for developers
=====================

The Frescobaldi LilyPond sheet music editor is written in Python and uses
Qt4 for its user interface, via the PyQt4 bindings.

All code and application data is in the frescobaldi_app/ directory. The
frescobaldi script just imports frescobaldi_app.main.  You can simply run
./frescobaldi from the commandline after unpacking Frescobaldi.

You can also install the 'frescobaldi_app' package in the system- or user-wide
python directories and the frescobaldi script in your PATH.  The distutils-based
installation procedure can do this.

'frescobaldi_app' is not a real package: on startup, the absolute
'frescobaldi_app' directory is added to sys.path and its own __path__ is cleared
so all modules and packages inside frescobaldi_app are available as toplevel
modules and packages.

Some larger components have their own packages:

ly:             LilyPond and the LY file format, tokenizer for LY and related
qpopplerview:   PDF viewer widget using the popplerqt4 binding to Poppler-Qt4
