Without the help of other people, Frescobaldi would not have been possible.

Besides the credits listed here, there is also information in about.py and
info.py from the frescobaldi_app/ directory.

Thanks go to the Python and Qt4 developers for providing excellent tools to
develop Frescobaldi with.

And thanks to the LilyPond developers for creating an amazing music engraver!
