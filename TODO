TODO for Frescobaldi 2.x
========================


- Text editor context menu

- LilyPond context help

- LilyPond->Engrave custom

- Edit->Select Block

- interface for running lilypond-book

- Midi input and import. Probably using a basic sequencer, allowing changes,
  corrections and quantizing touchups before putting the LilyPond representation
  in the editor.

- define and extend api for script snippets

- tool to separate out things from music and attach them to invisible rests (s)
  in a separate expression

- check or even auto-insert bar checks

- document structure panel

- editing via Music View:
  * relevant context menu on right-clicking object
  * drag an object to e.g. create an \override #'extra-offset command

- tool or panel to insert special characters from a unicode character map


Other ideas/wishes
==================


- support for Git/Hg/Svn diff/revert/commit

- play from cursor: plays music to MIDI output
